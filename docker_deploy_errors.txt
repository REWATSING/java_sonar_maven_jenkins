The error message you encountered indicates a permission issue while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket. The Jenkins user likely does not have the necessary permissions to interact with Docker.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

    Ensure that the Jenkins user is added to the docker group:
        Open a terminal and run the following command as a user with administrative privileges: sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
        Replace jenkins with the username of the Jenkins user, if it differs.

    Restart the Jenkins service:
        Restart the Jenkins service to apply the group changes: sudo service jenkins restart

    Verify Docker permissions:
        Log in as the Jenkins user or switch to the Jenkins user in the terminal: su - jenkins
        Check if you can run Docker commands without using sudo: docker run hello-world
        If the command executes successfully without requiring sudo, the Docker permissions should be resolved.

    Retry your Jenkins job:
        Trigger the Jenkins job again and verify if the issue is resolved.

By adding the Jenkins user to the docker group, you grant it the necessary permissions to interact with the Docker daemon. However, keep in mind that this approach allows the Jenkins user to have full access to Docker, so ensure that you trust the Jenkins environment and its users.

If the issue persists or you encounter further difficulties, please provide additional details about your environment, such as the operating system, Jenkins version, and any relevant configuration details, so that I can assist you further.

The error message you encountered indicates that the port 9090 is already in use by another process, and therefore, Docker is unable to bind to it.

To resolve this issue, you have a few options:

    Choose a different port: Update the -p flag in your docker run command to use a different port number that is not currently in use. For example, you can change it to -p 8080:9090 or any other available port.

    Stop the conflicting process: Identify the process that is using port 9090 and stop it. You can use the lsof command to find the process. Run sudo lsof -i :9090 to identify the process ID (PID) and then terminate it using kill <PID>.

    Use a different container name: Change the --name parameter in your docker run command to a unique name that is not currently being used by another container.

Once you have made the necessary adjustments, try running the docker run command again or trigger your Jenkins job to see if the issue is resolved.

If you continue to encounter difficulties, please provide additional information about your environment, such as the operating system and any relevant configuration details, so that I can assist you further.

The error message indicates that there is already a container with the name "/6444bb55d405" that is running. Docker requires unique names for each container.

To resolve this issue, you can choose one of the following options:

    Remove or stop the existing container: If the existing container is no longer needed, you can remove it using the following command:

    bash

docker rm <container_name_or_id>

Replace <container_name_or_id> with the actual name or ID of the container you want to remove. After removing the existing container, you can rerun the docker run command with the desired container name.

Use a different container name: Modify the --name parameter in your docker run command to use a different name that is not currently in use by any other container. For example:

css

    docker run --rm -d -p 9090:9090 --name my-tomcat-container tomcat:latest

Choose the option that suits your requirements and ensures unique container names. After making the necessary changes, try running the docker run command again or trigger your Jenkins job to see if the issue is resolved.

If you have any further questions, please let me know!
